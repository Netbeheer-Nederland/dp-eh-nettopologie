  This data product for EnergyHubs describes which information and data to
  exchange between DSO and customer/advisor when establishing an EnergyHub. A
  minimum set of data is defined that all operators are expected to conform to,
  along with a number of optional properties and data types.

  The data is intended to be presented as a hierarchy with a
  [TopologyDataSet](TopologyDataSet.md) at its root, then
  [Substation-s](Substation.md) nested inside the TopologyDataSet. A grid
  connection (*Aansluiting*) is defined as a [UsagePoint](UsagePoint.md) and
  related to a [Bay](Bay.md) through [EnergyConnection-s](EnergyConnection.md).
